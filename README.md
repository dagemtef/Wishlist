## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Even though I added the recycle view adapter it would not allow me to update my list. It seems like only the first click of the button allows the
item in the list to be shown but the consecutive clicks do not. I am confused as to why this is happening. I tried following all the steps of how to implement
a recycler view but it still does not work.
